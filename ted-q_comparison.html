    <h2>Comparing questions asked about a text</h2>

    <p class="intro">
        We are linguistics researchers interested in <i>how reading a text can evoke a question</i>.
        For instance, if you read "I'm a bit worried.", this evokes the question "Worried about what?".
        <br><br>
        Previously we have presented texts to various people, and asked them "What question does the text evoke?". This resulted in thousands of evoked questions.         We need your help to organize these. In particular: <mark><b>help us judge how the questions entered by different people are related</b></mark>.
        <br><br>
        In this HIT you will get <span id="num_images"></span> text snippets, for a total of <span id="num_names"></span> question comparisons.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        For each text snippet you are given a <b>Target question (T)</b> and a number of <b>Comparison questions (C)</b>. For each comparison, you have to choose between:

        <b>This can be a tricky task!</b> The quality of your responses is vital to our research, therefore we included <mark>quality control items</mark> in each HIT. Low quality responses can result in rejection -- but we are compassionate humans and try to be fair.
        <br><br>
        <b>Final advice:</b> What we want you to compare is <mark><i>what kind of information</i> the questions are asking for</mark>, not <i>how</i> they are asking it. Therefore: look beyond superficial appearance, interpret the questions in the context of the text snippet, and think: what sort of answers would each question invite? If they invite the same kinds of answers, then they are the same kind of question. <br><br> Good luck!
